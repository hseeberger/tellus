# tellus-cluster-demo-tui

A terminal observer for the [cluster demo](../tellus-cluster-demo): five nodes under continuous
chaos, watched from one screen while the chaos agent keeps running. It changes nothing in the
cluster.

This package is not published, like the rest of the workspace; it is part of `just all`.

## Running

With the Docker Compose stack up (`just start-cluster-demo-compose`), or the kind stack (`just
start-cluster-demo-k8s`, see the demo's README for its prerequisites):

```shell
just run-cluster-demo-tui     # watch the running demo
```

The observer is built from source and runs on the host, not in a container; both stacks map the
same host ports, so it works against either unchanged.

Keys: `q` or `Esc` quit, `↑`/`↓` or `Tab` select a node, `p` pauses the timeline, `c` clears it.
Pausing freezes the visible timeline window only; everything else keeps updating and entries keep
arriving behind the window.

## Configuration

Two environment variables, both optional:

- `TELLUS_NODES`: comma separated base URLs of the nodes' HTTP APIs, by default
  `http://localhost:8091` to `http://localhost:8095`, the Compose stack's host ports.
- `TELLUS_VERIFIER`: the verifier's base URL, by default `http://localhost:8081`.

## What it shows and where it comes from

- **The membership matrix**: one row per node, one column per address any node lists or
  advertises, each cell what the row's node currently says about the column's address: `up`,
  `down`, `up+down` (a retained Down entry beside a fresh Up one, i.e. a restart whose old
  incarnation is not forgotten yet), `unreach` (Up but derived unreachable), `me`, or `?`. A
  partition shows as a block pattern, convergence as the matrix turning uniform. A row whose
  inspect stream is lost is dimmed and marked stale, since nothing feeds it anymore.
- **The selected node's detail**: both streams' health, the cluster state version, the phase,
  the receptionist's counts and its verdict with the version it judged (flagged when that is not
  the state's version), the member list with incarnations, publishers heard within the freshness
  window, and the last probe round trips.
- **The verifier strip**: the chaos agent's current action, how long it has been quiet,
  verifications, violations and the load balancer's availability.
- **The timeline**: membership transitions per node, verdict flips, phase changes, chaos
  transitions, verdicts, violations and load balancer changes, merged across sources and ordered
  by the servers' own timestamps.

Every node is followed through two streams. `/inspect/events` is
[`tellus-cluster-inspect`](../tellus-cluster-inspect): one whole `ClusterState` per version and
the receptionist's verdict whenever it flips, in the order tellus published them. `/events` is
the demo's own: the phase and the receptionist's counts for the demo's keys. The matrix, the
detail and the strip are rendered from the latest snapshot each source delivered; the timeline is
the one history, built only from the streams, which replay their retained history on connect and
continue after `Last-Event-ID` on a reconnect. The polled `/cluster`, `/probe` and `/status` fill
in only what no stream has said yet.

Some consequences worth knowing:

- Transitions name the member, address plus the last four digits of its incarnation, so a restart
  reads as the old incarnation down and the new one up; the cell stays per address and reads
  `up+down` until the old entry is forgotten.
- A node restart, seen as a changed `started_at` on the inspect stream's hello, resets that node's
  row and its diff baseline; the first state afterwards seeds the baseline without producing
  transitions. When a stream reconnects and the server no longer retains the client's position
  ("history lost"), the baseline is cleared as well and the server hands out the retained history
  followed by the current state and verdict; a state equal to the displayed one re-arms the diff,
  an older one is ignored.
- A `fell behind` entry is tellus's own `Change::Gap`: the node's subscriber missed that many
  changes, and the current state and verdict follow, so nothing stays stale.
- A verdict streams the moment it flips and is shown with the version it judged, never as if it
  judged another state.
- Each stream's glyph turns red when it is lost, and a loss is one timeline entry, not one per
  reconnect attempt.
