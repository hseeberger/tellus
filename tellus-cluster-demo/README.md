# tellus-cluster-demo

A five node tellus cluster which runs forever under continuous chaos, on Docker Compose or on
Kubernetes.

The nodes find each other through seed discovery, DNS or the Kubernetes API, a chaos agent
crashes one node or partitions two nodes off the other three every cycle, a load balancer in
front of the nodes stays available throughout, and a verifier holds the cluster to its promises
once every quiet window. Both stacks run the same two binaries, node and verifier, and prove the
same things; what differs is who starts the containers and how a fault is injected.

## Running it

Docker Compose, with DNS discovery:

```sh
just start-cluster-demo-compose  # build the image and start everything
just logs-cluster-demo-compose   # follow all logs, or `just logs-cluster-demo-compose node1 chaos`
just stop-cluster-demo-compose   # stop everything and drop the volumes
```

Kubernetes, in a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) cluster of its own, with either discovery:

```sh
just start-cluster-demo-k8s      # dns discovery; `just start-cluster-demo-k8s k8s` for the other
just logs-cluster-demo-k8s       # follow all logs, or `just logs-cluster-demo-k8s tellus-2`
just stop-cluster-demo-k8s       # delete the cluster
```

Whichever stack runs, the same recipes look at it, since both serve the same ports:

```sh
just status-cluster-demo         # one node's view through the balancer, plus the verifier's counters
just violations-cluster-demo     # what the verifier found wanting, empty on a healthy run
just run-cluster-demo-tui        # watch it all from a terminal, see tellus-cluster-demo-tui
```

It needs `kind` v0.33 or later and `kubectl`, and it serves the same URLs on the same ports, so
everything below applies to both stacks. Only one of them can run at a time, since they share
those ports. `just run-cluster-demo-tui` is the same against either: it builds and runs the
[terminal observer](../tellus-cluster-demo-tui) from source on the host, not in a container, and
connects to those ports.

- `http://localhost:8080/cluster`: what one node, whichever the load balancer picks, sees of the
  cluster. Repeated calls during a partition show the two sides disagreeing, and then agreeing
  again.
- `http://localhost:8080/probe`: what that node's messaging to every other member yields, a
  discovery lookup plus an ask per member. Membership converging while asks fail would be a bug
  the member list alone hides.
- `http://localhost:8091/cluster` through `http://localhost:8095/cluster`: the same, but one
  named node rather than whichever the load balancer picks, which you want while the cluster is
  split.
- `http://localhost:8091/inspect/cluster` through `http://localhost:8095/inspect/cluster` and
  `/inspect/events`: [`tellus-cluster-inspect`](../tellus-cluster-inspect), mounted as any
  application would mount it: the node's `ClusterState` with every member's incarnation, its
  lifecycle and the receptionist's verdict as a snapshot, and every change of them as a
  server-sent events stream, resumable and never silently skipping; `curl -N` shows it, the
  [terminal observer](../tellus-cluster-demo-tui) renders it.
- `http://localhost:8091/events` through `http://localhost:8095/events`: the demo's own stream
  beside it: the node's phase and the receptionist's counts for the demo's keys.
- `http://localhost:8081/status`: the verifier's counters, including the load balancer's
  availability and the current chaos action.
- `http://localhost:8081/violations`: what the cluster failed to deliver, empty on a healthy run.
- `http://localhost:8081/events`: the verifier's stream: chaos transitions as it observes them,
  verdicts, violations and load balancer availability changes.

## The parts

Under Docker Compose:

- **The nodes** (`src/bin/node.rs`), five containers with static addresses on the `cluster`
  network, all sharing the network alias `tellus`, so Docker's DNS answers that one name with all
  five addresses. The `seeds` section names that one name, `DnsSeeds` resolves it and
  `cluster::bootstrap` joins through it, so nothing but the name is configured. Each node is on a
  second network, `edge`, carrying nothing but HTTP: a partitioned node stays reachable for the load
  balancer and can report that it sees everyone else as unreachable and has downed itself. Each
  node mounts `tellus-cluster-inspect` at `/inspect`, logs every transition
  `ClusterState::diff` yields between consecutive versions of `cluster::changes`, and serves the
  demo's own facts, phase and receptionist counts, as a small stream of its own at `/events`.
- **The load balancer** (`Caddyfile`), health checking all five nodes every two seconds, so a
  crashed or self-downed node leaves the rotation before it stops answering.
- **The chaos agent** (`chaos.sh`), rotating through three faults: `pumba kill` for a crash,
  `pumba netem loss --percent 100` in both directions between the two sides for a partition, and
  a SIGTERM for a clean departure, which the cluster handles through `leave` rather than through
  failure detection. A container signalled through the Docker API counts as manually stopped, so
  no restart policy brings it back and the agent starts it again itself. It names the fault it is
  running in a state file, which lets the verifier tell a legitimate disagreement from a
  violation.
- **The verifier** (`src/bin/verifier.rs`), polling the load balancer twice a second, and once
  per quiet window checking that every node is a member, that every node sees all five as Up and
  none of them as unreachable, that every node's receptionist resolves all five workers and is
  settled at the version it shows, that every
  node resolves all five subscribers of the event topic and has received an event from every node
  within the last seconds, and that every node can message every other one. It serves its own
  `/events` stream as well: the chaos transitions it reads from the state file, each verdict,
  each violation and each change of the load balancer's availability.

On Kubernetes the nodes are a StatefulSet of five behind a headless service, the load balancer is
a service rather than Caddy, a partition is a pair of NetworkPolicies the agent switches on by
labelling pods, and the agent shares a pod with the verifier so the two still meet over a file.
[`k8s/README.md`](k8s/README.md) explains each of those, including why the nodes are a
StatefulSet when a Deployment is the natural default. The verifier is the same binary with the
same configuration, and is unaware of which stack it runs on.

## What it shows

- **Bootstrap**: five nodes starting at once resolve one DNS name to each other, none of them
  admits anyone until one forms, the lowest address does, and the rest join it. A restarted node
  rejoins through the same name.
- **Departure versus death**: a node stopped with SIGTERM announces its departure and is downed
  within a gossip round, while a killed one has to be detected. Each rotation hence shows both
  ways out of a cluster next to each other.
- **Crash detection**: a killed node's silence is noticed by the survivors' failure detectors and
  turned into a death by their downing providers, each on its own clock.
- **Partition resolution**: the majority downs the minority, and the minority, which cannot know
  it is the minority until it counts, downs itself. `KeepMajority` is what makes the two sides
  agree without talking to each other.
- **Restart to rejoin**: a downed node is dead for good, so the node process exits on its own,
  and the restart policy brings it back with a fresh incarnation the cluster admits.
- **Availability under all of it**: the load balancer answers throughout, which is the point of a
  cluster whose parts keep failing.
- **Cluster state as a value**: every node follows `cluster::changes` and logs each transition
  `ClusterState::diff` yields between two consecutive versions, a member joining, going Down,
  becoming unreachable or reachable again, each named by address and incarnation; `GET /cluster`
  answers the whole state, and `/inspect/events` streams every version of it. Versions increase
  by one per observed change, and a subscriber that fell behind is told of the gap and handed the
  current state instead of a transition it never saw.
- **Receptionist**: every node resolves all five workers by key without asking anyone, from the
  registrations the members replicated to it, and reports whether its directory is complete for
  its cluster state version; `GET /cluster` answers both. The probes keep resolving through the
  point lookup, so both paths stay exercised.
- **Pub-sub**: every node publishes an event a second to a topic every node's listener subscribes
  to, and `GET /cluster` answers how many subscribers it resolves and whom it heard from within
  the last seconds. A quiet window hence shows fan-out reaching every member, a restarted one
  included, through the subscription which replicated after its rejoin.

## Configuration

[`config/default.yaml`](config/default.yaml) carries everything the five nodes share, loaded with
[configured](https://github.com/hseeberger/configured) into tellus's own `BootstrapConfig` and
`EndpointConfig`. The compose file and the manifests add only what differs per node, as the
`CFG__NODE_NAME` and `CFG__ENDPOINT__ADVERTISED_ADDR` overrides configured layers on top. An
override is spelled `CFG__<SECTION>__<KEY>`, with double underscores between segments.

Which discovery a node uses is the one thing the default file does not carry. `CONFIG_OVERLAYS`
names [`config/dns.yaml`](config/dns.yaml) or [`config/k8s.yaml`](config/k8s.yaml), and that
overlay contributes the whole `seeds` section: overlays merge key by key, so a `seeds` in the
default file would leave a node configured for both at once, which deserializes into neither. A
node started without the variable does not start at all, which is the right answer to a node
which was never told how to find the others.

The relevant settings are:

- `bootstrap.min_peers` (5): how many addresses discovery must resolve, unchanged for the settle
  window, before a node joins. Sizing it to the deployment keeps five simultaneously starting
  nodes from forming two clusters which never merge. In exchange, no node can bootstrap while
  fewer than five addresses resolve, so a restarting node waits until all five containers are
  running again. That suits a fixed size cluster and not an elastic one.
- `QUIET_SECS`, `PARTITION_SECS`, `RECOVERY_SECS`, `DEAD_SECS` under Compose only, (chaos) and
  `TELLUS_SETTLE_SECS` (verifier): the verifier only checks after the chaos agent has been quiet
  for the settle window, so the settle window must stay below the quiet window, and the quiet
  window must be long enough for a restarted node to have rejoined.
- The `endpoint` section spells out the pluggable provider defaults, the adaptive phi accrual
  detector and `KeepMajority` after ten seconds of unreachability, so what the demo shows is what
  a deployment gets, visibly rather than implied. Every other `EndpointConfig` field keeps its
  default implicitly.

## Caveats

- The nodes wrap the transport in a two second connect timeout. QUIC gives up on a silent address
  only after its own handshake timeout, tens of seconds, and a partition leaves three of the four
  seeds silent, so an unbounded bootstrap round would outlast the fault it is meant to survive.
- The nodes use `QuicTransport::dev`, which does not verify certificates. That lets the demo run
  without a certificate authority; a deployment uses `QuicTransport::mutual_tls`, which
  additionally binds each peer's advertised address to its certificate's IP SANs.
- Both the nodes and the containers pumba touches need `NET_ADMIN` and `iproute2`, since pumba
  installs its tc rules inside the target container. Compose only.
- A node self-downing mid-partition exits, so its container restarts without pumba's rules, which
  ends that node's side of the partition early. The fault is a container level one, and the
  demo's timings are sized so the interesting part has happened by then. Compose only: on
  Kubernetes the fault is a label on the pod, which a restarting container keeps.
- The kind cluster lowers the kubelet's restart backoff to two seconds. A node downed by the
  cluster exits on purpose, which the kubelet cannot tell from a crash loop, and its default
  backoff of up to five minutes would stall a demo whose point is continuous chaos. A real
  deployment keeps the default, so a self-downed node there is away for longer.
- The Kubernetes partition cuts with a NetworkPolicy, which drops what crosses rather than losing
  it in transit the way pumba's packet loss does. It is a cleaner fault than the network gives
  you, and it is why the Compose stack keeps pumba rather than being retired. A policy also only
  applies to connections which are new when it arrives, so the fault needs a privileged helper to
  forget the cluster's existing flows before it cuts anything at all; `k8s/README.md` explains
  that, and it is the most surprising thing in this demo.
- The Kubernetes crash fault has no fixed dead window. Deleting a pod means the StatefulSet
  replaces it at once, and the replacement usually comes up on a different address, so the
  crashed member is gone for good and has to be detected before the cluster can converge. Compose
  needs its `DEAD_SECS` only because a container comes back at the same static address.
