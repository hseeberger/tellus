//! Clustered remoting: actors on different nodes messaging each other through ordinary,
//! serializable [ActorRef]s, within a cluster they are members of (`cluster` feature).
//!
//! Each process runs at most one remoting endpoint, started via [start_endpoint] with a [Transport]
//! (the provided one is [QuicTransport]) and an [EndpointConfig]. [ActorRef] implements `Serialize`
//! and `Deserialize`, both failing with [RefError::EndpointNotStarted] until the endpoint is
//! started: message types embed reference fields, e.g. `reply_to: ActorRef<Reply>`, and work
//! unchanged no matter where their counterpart lives. Serializing a local reference lazily binds
//! the actor in the endpoint's registry, so inbound messages find it; the binding is evicted once
//! the actor terminates. Message payloads are encoded by a [Codec], by default [Postcard].
//!
//! The nodes messaging each other form a *cluster*, and membership is not optional: a started
//! endpoint is not a cluster and admits nobody, [form] makes it a cluster of one and [join] makes
//! it a member of the cluster one of its seed addresses is in, and only members message each other.
//! The member list is gossiped, so every member learns every other from one seed address; [members]
//! lists them and [down] removes one by operator decision. A node shutting down cleanly announces
//! its own departure with [leave](fn@leave), or with [leave_on_terminated] where one actor system's
//! lifetime is the node's lifetime, so the cluster removes it at once instead of detecting its
//! silence. Every member is heartbeated, and a [FailureDetector] (default: the adaptive
//! [PhiAccrualFailureDetector]) marks silent members locally unreachable. The [DowningProvider]
//! (default: [KeepMajority]) decides when an unreachable member is *downed*, i.e. dead for good.
//! Downing fails the member's pending asks, signals its watchers and refuses its incarnation from
//! then on, so a downed node rejoins only as a restarted process. The default resolves a partition
//! towards one side: the majority downs what it cannot reach, the minority downs itself.
//!
//! Bootstrap goes through joining and discovery: [register] names a local actor under a [Key] and
//! [lookup] resolves that name at a member's address, so nothing but a name and the seed addresses
//! has to be configured. The seed addresses themselves can be discovered: [bootstrap](fn@bootstrap)
//! resolves them through a [SeedDiscovery], waits for the view to settle, and joins through it.
//! The provided discoveries are [FixedSeeds] here, DNS in the `tellus-bootstrap-dns` crate and
//! Kubernetes pods in the `tellus-bootstrap-k8s` crate. When no resolved address is a member of
//! anything, bootstrap forms a cluster as its [FormationProvider] decides, by default [Majority]:
//! at the lowest address of a majority. Requiring a majority keeps a partitioned node from coming
//! back as a cluster of its own. Bootstrap runs once; from then on membership owns failure
//! detection and downing. Alternatively [serialize_ref] turns a local reference into bytes to be
//! shared via configuration, command line or any other channel, and [deserialize_ref] resolves
//! them on another node, refusing bytes serialized for another message type as
//! [RefError::TypeMismatch]. Any further reference travels inside messages.
//!
//! # Guarantees
//!
//! Remote [ActorRef::tell] keeps the local contract: fire-and-forget, at-most-once, undeliverable
//! messages are dropped and logged as dead letters. This covers an unreachable or crashed node, a
//! full outbound queue and a payload which cannot be decoded on the receiving node. Messages from
//! one sender to one target arrive in send order: all frames towards one actor ride one ordered
//! stream of the lane towards its node, enqueued at tell time and delivered to mailboxes in
//! arrival order, so a large message only delays frames towards actors sharing its stream. A lost
//! connection is reconnected with backoff; frames queued while the link is down flush in order,
//! so per-sender FIFO across reconnects is "in order, with gaps".
//!
//! Death watch works across nodes through the ordinary [ActorContext::watch], with a two tier
//! contract. A terminated signal for a *real termination* keeps the full local guarantee: it is
//! ordered behind all messages the terminated actor delivered to the watcher and proves its
//! destructors have run. A signal *synthesized* when the watched actor's member is downed only
//! proves that no message from that actor will ever be delivered through this endpoint again. The
//! two are indistinguishable in the API, and watching presumes membership: a watch on a node which
//! is not an Up member fires the synthesized signal immediately. See docs/cluster.md for the full
//! contract and its rationale.
//!
//! Request-response crosses nodes the same way: [ReplyTo] is serializable and travels inside
//! messages, so [ActorRef::ask] and [ActorContext::reply_to] work unchanged against remote
//! actors. An ask still resolves exactly once, at latest at its timeout, and a reply keeps
//! per-sender FIFO with the responder's other messages to the asker. The `NoReply` detection
//! weakens to best-effort: a reply destination dropped on another node is signalled
//! fire-and-forget, a request dead-lettered undecoded on the receiving node is answered the same
//! way, and downing a member fails the asks pending towards it; see docs/cluster.md for the
//! exact contract.
