//! Unit testing of actor logic without a running actor system: [TestContext] provides the
//! [ActorContext] which [Actor::init] and [Actor::receive] require, as well as `handle` and
//! `recovered` of `EventSourced`, and collects what the actor sends to itself. With the
//! `persistence` feature, `settle` additionally runs the `Effect` returned by `handle` against
//! the actor's state, without any store.

/// An [ActorContext] together with the mailbox behind it, for calling an actor's methods directly.
///
/// Everything the actor sends to itself arrives in the mailbox: [ActorRef::tell] on
/// [ActorContext::self_ref], the replies of a [ReplyTo] from [ActorContext::reply_to], and the
/// [Incoming::Terminated] signal of [ActorContext::watch] on an actor which has already
/// terminated. [TestContext::take_incoming] returns it in FIFO order.
///
/// Calling an actor directly bypasses the run loop. Notably, a terminated signal passed to
/// [Actor::receive] is not dropped when its sender is no longer watched, and nothing restarts the
/// actor on failure. [ActorContext::spawn] still spawns a real child actor, hence needs a Tokio
/// runtime; the child is asked to stop when the [TestContext] is dropped, and
/// [TestContext::terminate] waits for it.
