//! The scatter-gather example across two nodes: the gatherer scatters its workload to a worker
//! pool on another node and gathers the partial results the workers send back.
//!
//! Both nodes run as separate processes, because a process hosts one remoting endpoint. Running
//! this example starts the gatherer node, which spawns itself again as the worker node, so a
//! single command runs the whole system.
//!
//! The worker node joins the gatherer's cluster through the gatherer's address as its seed; only
//! members can message each other. The reference to the worker pool is then the only one not
//! travelling inside a message: the worker node registers its pool under a key and the gatherer
//! node looks that key up at the address it started the worker node on, so nothing but a name and
//! two addresses is exchanged. A lookup issued before the worker node has joined answers
//! `NotAMember`, one issued before the pool is registered answers `NotFound`; both are ordinary
//! bootstrap answers, which is why the gatherer retries them. Every further reference travels
//! inside messages: `Work::Scatter` carries `reply_to: ActorRef<Partial>` for the gatherer, which
//! the worker pool hands to the workers it spawns locally. Those workers tell their partial results
//! to an actor on another node through the same `ActorRef` and `tell` they would use locally. Note
//! also that `Compute` needs no serde derives at all: it never crosses the wire, yet it carries a
//! reference to a remote actor.
//!
//! Unlike the local scatter-gather example the gatherer counts the partial results instead of
//! watching its workers: their references never travel to the gatherer. Remote death watch exists
//! (see docs/cluster.md), but a signal synthesized for a dead node cannot prove that a partial
//! result has arrived, so this gatherer counts replies instead.
//!
//! The results are printed to stdout and tellus logs to stderr; the log level is configured via
//! `RUST_LOG`, e.g. `RUST_LOG=tellus=debug cargo run --quiet --features cluster-dev --example
//! remote_scatter_gather`.
