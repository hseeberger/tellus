//! A four node cluster in four processes: an observer plus three member nodes, showing what
//! membership adds to remoting.
//!
//! Every member node is started with a single seed address, the observer's, and learns the rest
//! of the cluster from gossip. Once converged, every node's own member list names all four,
//! which the observer proves by asking each node what it sees rather than by trusting its own
//! view.
//!
//! Then one node is killed, and at the end the survivors are stopped, which shows the two ways
//! out of a cluster side by side: a node which vanishes is detected, a node which shuts down
//! cleanly announces its own departure and is downed within a gossip round.
//!
//! What happens when a node is killed? Its silence is noticed by the other nodes' failure
//! detectors. Their downing providers turn that into a decision (three of four members are still
//! reachable, so the majority downs the fourth). The death watch the observer holds on an actor of
//! the killed node fires a synthesized terminated signal, the weaker of the two tiers of the watch
//! contract (see docs/cluster.md): it promises not that the actor's destructors ran, but that
//! nothing from it is ever delivered here again. Each survivor downs the node on its own clock,
//! which the observer again proves by asking them, and the cluster keeps working afterwards: the
//! survivors are stopped through ordinary messages.
//!
//! All four nodes run as separate processes, because a process hosts one remoting endpoint.
//! Running this example starts the observer, which spawns the member nodes as children, so a
//! single command runs the whole cluster.
//!
//! The results are printed to stdout and tellus logs to stderr; the log level is configured via
//! `RUST_LOG`, e.g. `RUST_LOG=tellus=debug cargo run --quiet --features cluster-dev --example
//! cluster`.
