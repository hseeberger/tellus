//! DNS seed discovery for tellus cluster bootstrap: [DnsSeeds] implements
//! [SeedDiscovery], resolving seed addresses from SRV records,
//! which carry address and port (e.g. a Kubernetes headless service), or from A/AAAA records
//! paired with a configured port. Pass it to [bootstrap](tellus::cluster::bootstrap), which
//! resolves until the view settles and joins the cluster through it, retrying resolve failures,
//! e.g. records still appearing while an orchestrator starts the other nodes.
//! SRV targets resolve concurrently; a failing target is skipped while any other resolves, and a
//! set resolving no address at all remains an error so bootstrap does not settle on it. Nothing
//! here distinguishes a stale target from a transient failure, because the resolver does not
//! either, so both are skipped alike. A partial view does settle, so a target failing throughout
//! the settle window shrinks the universe a
//! [FormationProvider](tellus::cluster::formation::FormationProvider) counts its majority against.
//!
//! Whatever is queried must resolve to one address per node, since bootstrap counts addresses and
//! a peer is only admitted at the address it advertises; on Kubernetes that makes the headless
//! service single stack, see this crate's README.
